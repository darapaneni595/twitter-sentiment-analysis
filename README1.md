# Twitter Sentiment and Engagement Analysis

This project analyzes Twitter data to understand user sentiment and engagement trends. It leverages Python for data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment analysis.

## Features
- Sentiment Analysis: Categorize tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Engagement Metrics: Analyze likes, retweets, and replies for insights.
- Data Visualization: Use plots to identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Files
- notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code and analysis.
- data.csv: Dataset containing raw Twitter data.
- README.md: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, jupyter

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Clone the Repository and Navigate:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-analysis.git
cd twitter-analysis

### Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk jupyter

### Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

## How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Remove unnecessary characters, stopwords, and noise from tweets.
   - Tokenize text for sentiment analysis.

2. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Use NLP tools (e.g., NLTK) to classify tweets into sentiment categories.

3. Engagement Analysis:
   - Evaluate likes, retweets, and replies to identify highly engaging tweets.

4. Visualization:
   - Generate charts to display sentiment distribution and engagement trends.

## Key Insights
- Sentiment affects user engagement: Positive tweets often receive higher likes and retweets.
- Visualization highlights trends in user interactions and sentiment patterns.
